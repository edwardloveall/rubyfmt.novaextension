Provides code formatting for ruby files via [rubyfmt](https://github.com/penelopezone/rubyfmt/).

## Installation

This requires the `rubyfmt` executable to be installed somewhere on your system. It can be downloaded from the [rubyfmt releases](https://github.com/fables-tales/rubyfmt/releases/latest). The path to that executable can then be set globally in the extension settings or per-project in the project settings.
